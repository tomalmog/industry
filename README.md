The game has recieved over 400 downloads and is still being downloaded approximately 50 times per month

## Development

**Industry** was developed over the course of a semester as a high school computer science capstone project. The development process focused on implementing complex game systems while maintaining clean, modular code architecture.

### Technical Implementation

The game features several sophisticated systems built from scratch:

- **Dynamic Factory Simulation**: Realtime resource calculations across interconnected production chains
- **Modular Building System**: Flexible architecture allowing for easy expansion of machine types and behaviors  
- **Intelligent UI Framework**: Custom inventory and upgrade interfaces with sorting and searching functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering and update loops to handle large-scale factory operations
- **Save System**: Comprehensive serialization of factory states and player progress

### Built With

- **Engine**: Godot 4
- **Language**: GDScript

The entire codebase demonstrates object oriented programming principles, efficient algorithms for resource management, and scalable game architecture suitable for continued expansion.
